    Coding creates a set of instructions for computers to follow. These instructions determine what actions a computer can and cannot take. 
    Coding allows programmers to build programs, such as websites and apps. Computer programmers can also tell computers how to process data in
    better, faster ways.
    Computer programmers split coding languages into two groups: low-level and high-level.

    Low-level languages, like binary, are considered "machine-oriented." Machine-oriented languages write instructions that must be specified in terms of the capabilities of the processor in question. Coders also refer to low-level languages as assembly language or machine code.

    High-level languages are user-oriented. Most of the popular coding languages, such as Python, fall under this category. Programmers designed high-level languages to convert an algorithm into program code more easily. 
    High-level coding languages are closer to human language â€” they include more nuance and adaptability than low-level coding languages.
